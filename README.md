# Library-Management-Micro-Service
Micro Service Codes for Library Management


## Run service by following the steps below:
1. make and activate a virtual environment (always)
2. install requirements.txt
3. open terminal and run uvicorn Service:app


## This is implemented till now
1. User Class and Functionality to create user; users with same user name or email will not be created.
2. Functionality for user to signin into his account. This will be used by super user to add books in librarys and do operations.
3. Endpoint for getting information for a use, but I guess this should restricted to super user only but being lazzy here.
4. Endpoint to list all users
